 * If you cannot measure the polling time for a status bit in the device status register,
 * you can derive it by establishing three separate values,
 * #AES132_STATUS_REG_POLL_TIME_COMM_NACK, #AES132_STATUS_REG_POLL_TIME_OVERHEAD,
 * and #AES132_STATUS_REG_POLL_TIME_LOOP.
 *
 * Time to poll the device status register:\n
 *    t_poll = t_comm + t_comm_overhead + t_loop,\n
 * where\n
 *    t_comm(when I2C address gets acknowledged)
 *       = (5 bytes * 9 clocks / i2c_clock + 2 * t_start + t_stop)\n

 *    t_loop = t_loop(aes132c_read_device_status_register())\n
 *
 * Example for AVR eight-bit CPU running at 16 MHz and I2C clocked at 400 kHz:\n
 *    t_comm = (5 bytes * 9 clocks /  400000 Hz + 2 * 2.2 us + 0.8 us) =  117.7 us\n
