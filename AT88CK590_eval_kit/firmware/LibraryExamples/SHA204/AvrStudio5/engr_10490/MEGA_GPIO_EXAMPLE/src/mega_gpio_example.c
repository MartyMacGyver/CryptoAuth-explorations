 /**
 * \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates GPIO port access, pin access, pin interrupt and
 * pin pull up configuration.
 *
 * \section files Files:
 * - mega_gpio_example.c: megaAVR GPIO example application
 * - conf_example.h: Example configuration
 *
 * \section setup Setup
 * This example is made for STK600 with two 10-pin cables in the following
 * strap configuration:
 * - PORTB <-> SWITCHES
 * - PORTD <-> LEDS
 *
 * \section description Description
 * The example will utilize different registers for setting and reading port
 * and pin GPIOs. These GPIOs are connected to switches and LEDs on the STK600.
 *
 * In the end of the example pin change interrupts are enabled and can be
 * tested with STK600 SW0. This will toggle LED0 from the interrupt handler.
 * Not all megaAVR devices supports pin change interrupts, so for those this
 * is disabled.
 *
 * For the best demonstration it's recommended to run this in a debug session
 * and single step thru the different operations.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU GCC</A>
 * for AVR. \n
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
