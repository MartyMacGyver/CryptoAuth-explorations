Building or rebuilding the project fails every other time.
Since I have not figured out how to start a debug session without building,
one has to make sure that the last intentional build fails so that a
debug session succeeds.
Or, the best approach is, because it achieves consistent results, to do a
clean on the project and then start a debug session.
