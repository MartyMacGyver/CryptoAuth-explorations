/** \defgroup atsha204_communication Module 02: Communication
 *
 * This module implements communication with the device. It does not depend on the interface
 * (SWI or I<SUP>2</SUP>C).
 *
 * Basic communication flow:
 * - Calculate CRC of command packet and append.
 * - Send command and repeat if it failed.
 * - Delay for minimum command execution time.
 * - Poll for response until maximum execution time. Repeat if communication failed.
 *
 * Retries are implemented including sending the command again depending on the type
 * of failure. A retry might include waking up the device which will be indicated by
 * an appropriate return status. The number of retries is defined with a macro and
 * can be set to 0 at compile time.
