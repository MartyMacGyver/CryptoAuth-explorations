/** \name Macros for Bit-Banged SWI Timing

Times to drive bits at 230.4 kbps.

take about 580 ns per iteration. Another 800 ns are needed to
access the port.

//! time to keep pin high for five pulses plus stop bit (used to bit-bang CryptoAuth 'zero' bit, in ns)

// One loop iteration for edge detection takes about 0.6 us on this hardware.
// Lets set the timeout value for start pulse detection to the uint8_t maximum.
//! This value is decremented while waiting for the falling edge of a start pulse.
#define START_PULSE_TIME_OUT  (255)

// We measured a loop count of 8 for the start pulse. That means it takes about
// 0.6 us per loop iteration. Maximum time between rising edge of start pulse
// and falling edge of zero pulse is 8.6 us. Therefore, a value of 26 (around 15 us)
// gives ample time to detect a zero pulse and also leaves enough time to detect
// the following start pulse.
// The values above were established using the WinAVR 2010 compiler.
// The code runs faster when compiled with the compiler version of Atmel Studio 6.
// In this case a timeout value of 26 leads to a timeout of 10 us which is still
// greater than 8.6 us.
//! This value is decremented while waiting for the falling edge of a zero pulse.
