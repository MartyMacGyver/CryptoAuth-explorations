//! @brief This function will start the on-chip bootloader after a watchdog timer reset.
//!
//! The function set a special key in sram (uninitialized during mcu start-up execution) and performs a mcu
//! watchdog timer reset.
//! This function should be called when a special eve,t is detected in the application that requires the bootloader activation.
//! When this function is used, be sure to implement the "start_boot_if_required()" function at the begining of main().   
//!

//! @brief This function calls the on-chip bootloader.
//!
//! The function starts the on-chip bootloader if the application has posted such a request.
//! This function sould be inserted at the begining of the main function.
