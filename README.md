# CryptoAuthentication Explorations

Explorations of the Atmel CryptoAuthentication devices, particularly the AT88CK590 eval kit

Disclaimer: This project involves modifying firmware and hardware if you flash firmware, etc. - while the eval kit's hardware isn't super expensive (around $20 USD), modding it will almost certainly void any warranties that might have existed.

Note: the project license (Apache 2.0) only applies to my own work and any derivate work not pre-empted by the other licenses present (so far this devkit code appears to be under BSD License 2.0 (the BSD "3 clause" license).

Warning: the original code has some super-long path names that will lead to odd build errors (where some files that are clearly present are not found). Keep the path to the rot of your clone of this repo relatively short (< about 45 characters).

**Coming soon:** how to modify the firmware and hardware to extend the functionality of this device, while learning about various aspects of the hardware and software including Atmel Studio, Atmel MCUs, USB comms, DFU mode, and some Python 3 as well!
