# CryptoAuthentication Explorations

Explorations of the Atmel CryptoAuthentication devices, particularly the AT88CK590 eval kit

Note: the project license (Apache 2.0) only applies to my own work and any derivate work not pre-empted by the other licenses present (so far this devkit code appears to be under BSD License 2.0 (the BSD "3 clause" license).

**Coming soon:** how to modify the firmware and hardware to extend the functionality of this device, while learning about various aspects of the hardware and software including Atmel Studio, Atmel MCUs, USB comms, DFU mode, and some Python 3 as well!
