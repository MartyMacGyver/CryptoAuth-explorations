# CryptoAuthentication Explorations

### Please visit [this project's wiki](https://github.com/MartyMacGyver/CryptoAuth-explorations/wiki) for more information on how to modify the firmware and hardware to extend the functionality of this device, while learning about various aspects of the hardware and software including Atmel Studio, Atmel MCUs, USB comms, DFU mode, and some Python 3 as well!

Explorations with the [Atmel CryptoAuthentication software and devices](http://www.atmel.com/products/security-ics/cryptoauthentication/default.aspx), as well as leveraging and extending the [AT88CK590 evaluation kit](http://www.atmel.com/tools/AT88CK590.aspx) USB dongle.

__Disclaimer:__ This project involves modifying firmware and hardware if you flash firmware, etc. - while the eval kit's hardware isn't super expensive (around $20 USD), modding it will almost certainly void any warranties that might have existed. This project is neither affiliated with nor sponsored by Microchip / Atmel.

The project license (Apache 2.0) only applies to my own work and any derivate work not preempted by the other licenses present (so far this devkit code appears to be under BSD License 2.0 (the BSD "3 clause" license).

Warning: the original code has some super-long path names that will lead to odd build errors (where some files that are clearly present are not found). Keep the path to the root directory of your clone of this repo relatively short (< about 45 characters).
